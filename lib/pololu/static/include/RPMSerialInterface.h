	SerialInterface

	The SerialInterface implements the Pololu Maestro serial communication protocol.
	See http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J40/5.e for the details of the commands available.

	The SerialInterface methods of the SerialInterface come into different flavours,
	each uses a different protocol:
	- Compact protocol (CP) 
	- Pololu protocol (PP)
	- Mini-SSC protocol (MSSCP)
	See http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J40/5.c for more information.

	Note: add the ability to specify min/max target value at construction time rather 
	than having it hard-coded.
